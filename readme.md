Combinations:

## General Observations

1. (Runecrafting) only appears viable if you pick Fremmenik - Fire runes from desert next best thing? Dayealt Essence worth? ZMI is probably OK with infinite run.
2. (Crafting) Difficult without superglass make from Fremmenik - Sand and shit may not be viable - Best for this is Fremmy or Mory
3. (Resource - Mage): Magic Armour is going to be a BITCCHCHHH without Kandarin (can't buy mystic)

## My Choice

**Desert + Asgarnia + Tirannwn**: Crafting and Runecrafting - Fire runes may still be good. Crafting ???? Flax from Zulrah? This may be a reason to pick the Process Relic... Zulrah wont be as Farmable without Trident. 4:30-6min kills. Need antipoisons, buyable from Jiminua's Jungle Store (No guthix rest...) Food will be annoying without Harvest... Same with construction... Gold Jewelry may still be viable, Clay can be mined with water bracelet + instant bank... Gold is slow to mine sooo where to get gold? Dragonhide shit may work with blue dragons. Making glass could still work but... making soda ash, then glass, then blowing... maybe not. Battlestaves? We have fire obelisk.

Gotchas:
**Herblore**: Secondaries and seeds (make sure you have patches!!!) (Red spider eggs spawn in wildy and varrock sewer, Tower of Life for Kandarin; Potatoe Cacti is pretty much desert only; Noted Eye of Newt from Kandarin or Asgarnia
**Resource - Mage**: Kandarin is the only freebie really - the others make you work...
**Construction**: No butler unless you pick Kandarin!!! (Tirannwn and Asgarnia both have alternatives)
**Resource - MSB**: Magic Shortbow is either 80 fletching or Spiritual Ranger (Or a lucky hard+ clue)
**Farming**: Birdhouse runs are the only viable way to get tree seeds. Watermelon+ Allotment seeds are really only viable from Temple Trekking
**Resource - Dragonstone**: Asgarnia or Tirannwn for Crystal Key. Wilderness has rogues chest. All others are RDT so be wary. Otherwise, get 83 hunter for dragon implings

Freebies:
**Fishing**: Karambwans (assuming Infinite Harvest)
**Cooking**: Karambwans
**Woodcutting**: Willows are free - you can grow Teak trees on Fossil Island
**Firemaking**: The old fashioned way
